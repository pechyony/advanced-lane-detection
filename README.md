# advanced-lane-detection
Project 4 in Udacity self-driving car nanodegree: detect continuous lines that represent lanes, visualize lanes, find radius of curvature and position of the car within lane.

## Setup

Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/doc/configure_via_anaconda.md) to set up Anaconda environment. You can verify that your environment is set up correctly using the instructions [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit-Test).

## Files
* Advanced Lane Detection.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with the code.
* writeup.md - description of lane line detection pipeline.
* camera_cal - folder of images used for camera calibration, provided by Udacity.
* test_images - folder of test images, provided by Udacity.
* output_images - folder of output of various stages of line detection pipeline, created by the code in Advanced Lane Detection.ipynb.
* output_videos - folder with the videos created by line detection pipeline, created by the code in Advanced Lane Detection.ipynb.


## Usage
After setting up the environment, open Advanced Lane Detection.ipynb in Jupyter notebook and run all the cells.
